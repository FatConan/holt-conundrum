We're going to try this 1000 times, with a randomised islander who's randomly heavier or lighter than the others to show it working:

The comments in the code of main.py should explain how the method works.


Initially divide the Islanders into 3 groups:
[Hank, Luke, Iain, Kyle] [Fred, Carl, Greg, Dave] [John, Brad, Andy, Erik]
