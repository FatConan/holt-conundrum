# holt-conundrum
A quick python solution to Captain Holt's brainteaser from Brooklyn 99.

"There are 12 men on an island, 11 weigh exactly the same amount, but one of them is either slightly heavier or lighter, you must figure out which."

"The island has no scales, but there is a seesaw, the exciting catch? You may only use it three times"

This python file implements an algorithm for finding the non-conformist in the group as well as giving the islanders names and showing you a wee ASCII representation of the seesaw's behaviour on the way to finding them.
